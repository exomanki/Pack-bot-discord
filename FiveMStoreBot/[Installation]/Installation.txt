A Linux/Windows/OSX server (e.g; VPS, Dedi).
Node.js (with npm) install via Windows install via Linux.
Text editor program (e.g; Visual Studio Code, Notepad++)

Step 2 - Creating A Discord Application
First off you will need to head on to the Discord developer portal and create an application.

Click on Bot > Add Bot. Then copy the token, use this in the config.json file in the next step. once done, go back to the General Information tab and copy the Client ID. Go to the below link and insert the client ID in the URL.

https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=8
Replace the CLIENT_ID_HERE with your bots Client ID. This will invite the bot into the selected Discord when you enter the URL.

Step 3 - Install Bot Files
Unpackage your bot into a folder where you wish to run the bot from. A folder on the desktop will work in most cases for Windows users. For Linux, the /home directory should work. Extract the package into the folder.

Step 4 - Configuration
FiveMStoreBot is a feature rich bot and with that is over 150 configuration options. Be sure to check out the FiveMStoreBot Configuration Documentation for details on each configuration option.
